U1a,"There is currently being research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium supports using thorium to create nuclear power since it is a safer alternative than uranium. Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on thorium, also supports using thorium since it is cheaper than using uranium. ",,,
U2a,"Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and an expert on phage therapy, advocates for phage therapy saying it has been effective in treating bacterial infections in Eastern Europe for many years now. Dr. Wilson, a physicist who is not an expert on phage therapy, also supports phage therapy because phages are much less likely to create a resistant infection since there are so many combinations of phages that can be used.

U3a,"Bioremediation is the process of using organisms to neutralize or remove contamination from waste. Bioremediation can clean up contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water. It stimulates the growth of certain microbes that use contaminants as a source of food and energy. Dr. Harris, a microbiologist and expert on bioremediation supports bioremediation since it relies on naturally occurring biological organisms to metabolize environmental pollutants and renders them harmless to humans. Dr. Anderson, a chemist who is not an expert on bioremediation also advocates for the process since it is a quick way to clean up contamination. ",,,
F1b,"Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms in which genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects or animals. Dr. Lewis, a crop ecologist and an expert on GMOs supports GM technology saying that it is the solution to the worlds’ food shortage. Dr. Hall, a virologist who is not an expert on GMOs opposes GM technology saying it might harm other organisms in the ecosystem, which could lead to a lower level of biodiversity. ",,,
F2b,"A stem cell is a generic cell that can make exact copies of itself indefinitely. A stem cell has the ability to make specialized cells for various tissues in the body, such as the heart muscle and brain tissue. Dr. King, a geneticist and expert on stem cell research advocates for the research since it can aid scientists in understanding why some cells develop abnormally and cause medical problems like cancer. On the other hand, Dr. Harris, a chemist and non-expert on stem cell research opposes it saying it might cause tumors if the cell is transplanted straight from undistinguished culture preps. ",,,
F3b,"Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is administered in two doses when the child is one and four years old. Dr. White, a virologist and expert on vaccines advocates for the MMR vaccine saying it is safe and effective for preventing the dangerous diseases. However, Dr. Blair, an ecologist who is not an expert on vaccines opposes the vaccination saying the risks associated, such as a severe allergic reaction, far outweigh the benefits. ",,,

U2c,"Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and an expert on phage therapy disagrees with phage therapy saying phages have the potential to mutate to create bacterial toxins that are harmful to humans. Dr. Wilson, a physicist who is not an expert on phage therapy also opposes phage therapy since they are so specific they are harder and more expensive to administer than antibiotics. ",,,

Dr. Harris, a microbiologist and expert on bioremediation opposes the process cautioning that bioremediation might turn the contaminant into another toxic by-product. Similarly. Dr. Anderson, a chemist who is not an expert on bioremediation also opposes it since it is difficult to control where the bacteria go.  ",,,
