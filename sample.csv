user02,L1,U1a,This story is about Uranium. Main topic is that replacement of Uranium to other material (I do not remember the name) is good for human because Uranium is dangerous and expensive.  ,2
user01,L1,U1a,"Research is being conducted to replace uranium with thorium.  Uranium causes leaks in nuclear structures due to fission.  Dr. Johnson, an expert on thorium, supports using thorium as a replacement because it is a safer alternative.  Dr. Williams, a biologist who is not an expert on thorium, supports the switch from uranium to thorium because of the lower cost of thorium.",1

user02,L1,U2a,"The story is about bacteria and theraphy, but I do not remember specific information.",2
user01,L1,U2a,"Because many strains of bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics because of over-use, researchers have started to look into phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics.  Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and expert on phage therapy, supports the transition because phages are less resistance-inducing than antibiotics.  Dr. Wilson, a physicist who is not an expert on phage therapy, supports the transition because there are so many combinations of phages that they are less resistance-prone.",1

user01,L1,U3a,"Bioremediation is a process of using biological material to remedy pollution.  It is used to clean rainwater runoff, oil spills, and other contaminant-driven damage.   It consists of using microbes to process and digest contaminants to render them harmless to humans.  Dr. Moore, a biologist who is an expert on bioremediation, supports the practice because it uses natural organisms to process contaminants and render them harmless to humans.  Dr. Wilson, a chemist who is not an expert on bioremediation, supports the practice because it is often a very quick way to clean up contaminants.",1
